//! # Relay Registry Contract — `errors.rs`
//!
//! Defines all error codes returned by the Relay Registry contract.
//! All errors are exposed as a `ContractError` enum that maps to Soroban
//! `contracterror` integer values consumable by clients.
//!
//! ## Error codes to implement
//! - `AlreadyRegistered (1)` — Node address is already registered in the registry
//! - `NotRegistered (2)` — Node address is not found in the registry
//! - `InsufficientStake (3)` — Stake amount is below the protocol minimum
//! - `NodeNotActive (4)` — Operation requires the node to be in Active status
//! - `NodeSlashed (5)` — Operation is blocked because the node has been slashed
//! - `StakeLocked (6)` — Unstake attempt during the stake lock period
//! - `UnauthorizedSlash (7)` — Caller is not authorized to slash this node
//! - `InvalidMetadata (8)` — Provided metadata fails validation
//! - `Overflow (9)` — Arithmetic overflow in stake calculation
//!
//! implementation tracked in GitHub issue

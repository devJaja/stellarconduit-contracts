//! # Treasury Contract — `lib.rs`
//!
//! This is the main entry point for the Protocol Treasury Soroban smart contract.
//! The treasury holds protocol funds for relay node incentive programs, grants for
//! operators in underserved and remote regions, and ongoing protocol development.
//!
//! ## Responsibilities
//! - Receive fee allocations from the Fee Distributor contract
//! - Disburse grants and incentives to relay node operators
//! - Track all inflows and outflows with on-chain transparency
//! - Enforce spending limits and require multi-sig authorization for withdrawals
//! - Support future handover to a DAO governance model
//!
//! ## Functions to implement
//! - `deposit(env, amount)` — Deposit funds into the protocol treasury
//! - `withdraw(env, amount, recipient, reason)` — Withdraw funds (authorized callers only)
//! - `allocate(env, program, amount)` — Allocate budget to a named spending program
//! - `get_balance(env)` — Fetch the current treasury token balance
//! - `get_history(env)` — Fetch the full on-chain transaction history
//!
//! ## See also
//! - `types.rs` — Data structures (TreasuryEntry, AllocationRecord, SpendingProgram)
//! - `storage.rs` — Persistent storage helpers
//! - `errors.rs` — Contract error codes
//!
//! implementation tracked in GitHub issue

//! # Fee Distributor Contract — `lib.rs`
//!
//! This is the main entry point for the Fee Distributor Soroban smart contract.
//! It exposes the public contract interface for protocol fee calculation and
//! distribution to relay nodes upon successful transaction settlement.
//!
//! ## Responsibilities
//! - Calculate relay fee based on batch size and transaction count
//! - Distribute fees to relay nodes upon confirmed settlement on Stellar
//! - Allocate a protocol treasury share from collected fees
//! - Track cumulative fee earnings per relay node
//! - Handle delayed fee claims for relay nodes
//!
//! ## Functions to implement
//! - `distribute(env, relay_address, batch_id)` — Distribute fee for a settled transaction batch
//! - `calculate_fee(env, batch_size)` — Calculate the fee for a given batch of transactions
//! - `claim(env, relay_address)` — Claim accumulated, unclaimed fees for a relay node
//! - `get_earnings(env, relay_address)` — View total lifetime earnings for a relay node
//! - `set_fee_rate(env, rate)` — Update the protocol fee rate (governance-only)
//!
//! ## See also
//! - `types.rs` — Data structures (FeeEntry, EarningsRecord, FeeConfig)
//! - `storage.rs` — Persistent storage helpers
//! - `errors.rs` — Contract error codes
//!
//! implementation tracked in GitHub issue

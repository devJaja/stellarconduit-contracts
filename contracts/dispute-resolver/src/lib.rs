//! # Dispute Resolver Contract — `lib.rs`
//!
//! This is the main entry point for the Dispute Resolver Soroban smart contract.
//! It handles final on-chain arbitration for double-spend conflicts that cannot be
//! resolved off-chain by the StellarConduit sync engine.
//!
//! ## Responsibilities
//! - Accept dispute submissions with cryptographic relay chain proofs
//! - Enforce dispute submission and response deadlines
//! - Evaluate competing cryptographic proofs deterministically
//! - Issue a final ruling and trigger appropriate fund recovery
//! - Penalize the relay node that submitted the invalid transaction
//!
//! ## Functions to implement
//! - `raise_dispute(env, tx_id, proof)` — Submit a new dispute with a relay chain proof
//! - `respond(env, dispute_id, proof)` — Submit a counter-proof to an open dispute
//! - `resolve(env, dispute_id)` — Resolve a dispute after the evaluation period
//! - `get_dispute(env, dispute_id)` — Fetch dispute details and current status
//! - `get_ruling(env, dispute_id)` — Fetch the final ruling for a resolved dispute
//!
//! ## See also
//! - `types.rs` — Data structures (Dispute, DisputeStatus, Ruling, RelayChainProof)
//! - `storage.rs` — Persistent storage helpers
//! - `errors.rs` — Contract error codes
//!
//! implementation tracked in GitHub issue
